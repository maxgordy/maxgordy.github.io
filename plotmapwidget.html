                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>While Montgomery County's inclusionary zoning policies have been widely praised, 
                    housing inequality has in the area has continued to rise. One of the reasons for this is
                    widespread exclusionary zoning that has prevented the creation of housing. The cluster of zipcodes
                    in the top right of the chart have very restrictive zoning, with over 75% of lots designated as single family. 
                    The proximity of these areas to DC's urban center has exacerbated the impact of these restrictions,
                    leading to skyrocketing housing prices, which are reflected in the area's high property values. 
                    These visualizations were created as part of a larger analysis on Montgomery County that can be read
